# SQL-projects
Few SQL projects on different datasets to showcase some of my SQL knowledge 

## covid 1 year
A SQL project using all the concepts I've learned with examples and comments, getting insights from the first year of the COVID-19 dataset.

## covid - all time
A similar project as the one above, only this time I used the latest dataset to date (approx 2020-2023) and different queries too.
